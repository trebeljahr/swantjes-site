	<div class="scrollable-container film-container"><p>intro</p><p>On a cold evening in March, a young girl starts traveling. She has nothing more than a camera and a few notebooks in her backpack. An airplane ticket to Kathmandu, Nepal, in her hands. Five months of time lay in front of her.</p><p>This is a short film series for everyone who fears to step out. A few jars full of courage. &nbsp;And a perspective on the world through the eyes of a 19-year-old girl.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card iframe-container" id="film-0"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ya1dqwOr_Zg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" class="single-film-container"></iframe></figure><p>1 arlanda <br>Somewhere in the middle of a Swedish airport a girl is lost. This is the first stopover - really not the place, nor the time to question a journey. But an unknown language roars from the speakers. Strangers jostle her. She never felt that small before. </p><p>Snow is falling outside of the window and she takes a deep breath. Sometimes there are moments in life, when you feel small. Sometimes there are moments in life, when you can’t do more than taking a deep breath. Sometimes there are moments in life, when you know that everything will be fine.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card iframe-container" id="film-1"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NsILmbXWlz8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" class="single-film-container"></iframe></figure><p>2 kathmandu </p><p>She was in chaos. There were people around her. The burning sun on her head. And dust in her lungs. &nbsp;It ´s unsure what happens in your brain in moments like these. You´re not able to handle the situation.</p><p>You just see and feel and smell. Instead of reacting you remember. As if those first days in a new country crystallize immediately.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card iframe-container" id="film-2"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e-R8ZvN0QlY?start=24&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" class="single-film-container"></iframe></figure><p>3 the bus </p><p>The moment she leaves dusty, crowded Kathmandu, she can breathe again. A country is bigger than just its capital city. And when you sit in a bus and new people enter at every station you get to see the faces of Nepal - a mother, a young school girl, a man dressed all in white.</p><p>Leave the town, go on a ride and open your eyes. <br></p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card iframe-container" id="film-3"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-8vOWdavqms?start=7&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" class="single-film-container"></iframe></figure>
		<p>4 monks </p><p>In uniform hours the days with the monks past by. &nbsp;In a small Buddhist monastery at the edge of a national park, she found a home for a week. Ran to the waterfall. Told German fairytales. And closed her eyes in the regular gong of the singing bowls. &nbsp; <br></p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card iframe-container" id="film-4"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qAX8E6_Z7Fc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" class="single-film-container"></iframe></figure><p><em>walking </em></p><p>Two girls were standing with a monk in the middle of the orange monastery „But can’t we just hike alone through the national park?“ Palden knit his brows „Of course, you can do whatever you want to. But you´re girls and you´re alone and who carries your backpacks?“ „We will.“</p><p>There wouldn’t be a better example for the naivety of 19-years-olds.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card iframe-container" id="film-5"><iframe src="https://wwwyoutube.com/embed/scY-wbmuOgg?start=2&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" class="single-film-container"></iframe></figure><p>5 anapurna </p><p>Her cardiovascular system was made up by her heart and circulatory system. With her heart working as a pump, pushing blood to her organs, tissues and cells. Her blood delivered the oxygen. When rethinking this part of the journey it is always this biochemical process that comes up to her mind. It must have functioned years already. Though it was here in Nepal, that she first sensed it.</p><p>Sensed how oxygen was flooding her cells.</p><p>Sensed what it was like to have a body.</p><p>Sensed what it was like to be alive.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card iframe-container" id="film-6"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5LEaE2zUdQs?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" class="single-film-container"></iframe></figure><p></p><p>6 calmness</p><p>This story for you soon-to-be-traveler you might take to heart.

		<p>7 sweetness</p><p>In one of the dusty streets of Nargakot, hidden behind wooden walls and corrugated sheets, there is dark room. They arrive early in the morning. A long bus ride in their bones. Still tired and exhausted from the heat. They order a cup of milk tea. Not even looking up. , When suddenly the room changes. I guess, miracles happen in places you never expect them to see.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card iframe-container" id="film-8"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ffOdlz3SoDA?start=19&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" class="single-film-container"></iframe></figure><p>8 humboldt</p><p>This life was to close to a dream she never dared to speak out loud.

This is one of Amit´s and she just listened to it, with glowing ears.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card iframe-container" id="film-10"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y8d2xXIwScg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" class="single-film-container"></iframe></figure><p>10 end</p><p>"Once upon a time there was a slender young girl standing for a minute alone in a big airport building in Kathmandu, Nepal. The last six weeks she had travelled through a small part of Nepal with a group of three friends."</p><p>The girl laid down her pencil. She had just written the last sentence in her Nepal diary, her great book of fairytales. In front of her jars were lining up. All open. Their colors floating inside the walls. Her brush had turned those colors to words. She was proud.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card iframe-container" id="film-11"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GvjCbHBE_Rg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" class="single-film-container"></iframe></figure></div>.
